Original Research comes from Gresham Investment Management [*Trend is Not Dead (It's just moved to a trendier neighborhood)*](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/files/trends-not-dead-babbedge-kerson-2019.pdf)

First begin by analzying the straddle-like return the trend followers exhibit. It should be noted that the data pulled in this case is liquid futures from Yahoo Finance and is not scaled for the correct value-to-point. Since value-to-points usually have the same consistent number and may be off by a factor of 2 or 3, the overall graph won't differ.

There was considerable amount of pusback in trend following arguing that Trend is dead. In this case the authors provide some arguments for why trend is not dead. The one that has stuck out to me is that trend following hasn't been a victim of overcrowding. Comparing a simple trend following 10x100 MA crossover strategy and looking at the cost of being 1 day late we can see that the strategies are consistently losing money. Its the fact that its consistent, if overwcrowding was present then the strategies wouldn't lose money at a consistent rate.
